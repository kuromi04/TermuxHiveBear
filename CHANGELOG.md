## [Unreleased Termux Patch] - 2026-08-23
### Fixed
- Fixed Option 6 (Storage) in `menu.sh` to correctly read models from `~/.cache/hivebear/models` instead of the native Rust `LocalIndex`, solving the "0 B" storage bug.
- Fixed Option 1 (Contribute Mesh) in `menu.sh` to auto-inject the local `.gguf` model with `--model`, preventing crashes related to HuggingFace API JSON decoding errors on Android.
